```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
mpg
```

## Scatter Plot
### first try

```{r cars}
# summary(cars)


# scatter plot
g <- ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x = displ, y=hwy))

g + geom_point()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
